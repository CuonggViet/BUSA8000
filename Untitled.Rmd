Looking at the images, we can observe that there seems to be a correlation between the percentage of black and Hispanic populations and the percentage of students who receive free or reduced lunch in a given school district. As the percentage of black and Hispanic populations increases, so does the percentage of students receiving free or reduced lunch.

Additionally, we can see that this trend is most pronounced in urban areas. In rural areas, the percentage of students receiving free or reduced lunch is generally lower, regardless of the demographic makeup of the population.

It's worth noting that while this correlation is interesting, it's important to be cautious when drawing conclusions from this data. There may be other factors at play that influence the percentage of students receiving free or reduced lunch, such as the overall economic conditions of the area or the quality of the schools themselves.
